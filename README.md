🔐 Password Complexity Checker Project in Python 🔐

I recently developed a simple yet effective password complexity checker using Python! 🐍💻

The project checks various criteria to determine the strength of a password, including:

Minimum length of 8 characters
At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one digit
At least one special character
